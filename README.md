# Moment-Frame-NSGA2
This is a working example of NSGA2 on a simple moment frame <br />The Moment frame is 15' wide by 20' tall with a 50kip lateral load and a 10k point load at the center of the frame beam

   Using PyNite for structural analysis and PyMOO for multi-objective optimization, we find a range of optimal section sizes that both minimize deflection and member self weight (performance and economy)
